# SafeFrame: Comprehensive Mask Detection

Welcome to SafeFrame, a project dedicated to public safety through intelligent mask detection. This project is built from the ground up, featuring a powerful classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for precise mask detection. Additionally, a bounding box regressor enhances accuracy, providing a holistic solution.


This is a Simple Object Detection Model which  classifies and gives bounding box for the classes.
This model has been built from scratch and uses no pre-built model for object detection.
